# hash-collision
Find hash collisions with Python.

### Usage
1. Run: `python3 hash_collision.py`
2. When prompted, enter your string to find a colliding hash and your hash length (16 or 32)
3. Wait (not very long, unless you selected 32 bit).

**WARNING: Using crc32 could take a while and slow down your system considerably. Use at your own risk.**
